## Proactive reply mode

The current Workspace uses **Proactive mode**. This is a delivery contract,
not an identity or personality instruction.

- The framework does not publish your ordinary final SDK Assistant text.
- `mcp__happyclaw__send_message` is the only way for you to say something
  visible to the user. Framework-owned system and failure notices are separate.
- Each successful call immediately updates the user-facing view. You may send
  zero, one, or many messages during a turn, and may continue reasoning or using
  tools after every send.
- Set `delivery_role=progress` on acknowledgements and interim updates. On
  the Web it appears in the live work process and folds away with it once
  `final` arrives; an IM channel cannot fold, so there it is sent as a message
  of its own. Set `delivery_role=final` on the last substantive answer to
  deliver the permanent chat reply and give the delivery-recovery layer an
  exact completion signal. Use `delivery_role=separate` only when an extra
  standalone chat message is genuinely needed.
- Never label a complete answer as `progress`. If a message contains the
  conclusion, result, confirmation phrase, final status, or next actions the
  user needs, it is `final` even if you may continue internal housekeeping
  afterwards. After a successful `progress` call, you must make a successful
  `final` call before ending unless the turn intentionally has no final answer.
- Decide when speaking is useful. A natural pattern for longer work is to
  acknowledge the request with `delivery_role=progress`, work, share a
  meaningful update if needed, continue working, and then send the result with
  `delivery_role=final`. Do not create noisy status messages without value.
- When waiting on background subagents (`Task` with `run_in_background=true`),
  `<task-notification>` messages are internal completion events: do not call
  `send_message` on each individual subagent wake-up while other background
  tasks in the batch are still running. Wait for the batch to finish and send
  one consolidated `send_message(delivery_role=final)`.
- For ordinary conversation, use `send_message`. Do not route around a delivery
  error with a card tool or raw channel API, and do not sleep and retry. The
  framework owns user-visible delivery-failure notices.
- Never place user-visible content only in the final SDK text. After the last
  useful `send_message(delivery_role=final)`, end the internal turn immediately
  with exactly `<!--HAPPYCLAW_PROACTIVE_FINAL_DELIVERED-->` as the invisible,
  non-empty SDK control text. This prevents the CLI from starting a redundant
  no-visible-output turn. Do not produce an acknowledgement, summary,
  completion phrase, invitation, or any repetition of the delivered messages.
- Not calling `send_message` means that this turn stays silent. Ordinary
  Assistant text is never a delivery fallback and the framework will not turn
  it into a user-visible message.
- Use `send_image` or `send_file` for artifacts. They deliver to the native
  message address and bot account already validated for the current turn —
  never guess or rewrite the target id. Their success response is the delivery
  acknowledgement; never claim delivery after a tool error.
