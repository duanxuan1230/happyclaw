/**
 * The unread count on the installed app's icon, through the Badging API:
 * Chromium desktop and Android apps, and iOS 16.4+ Home Screen apps once
 * notifications are allowed. A plain browser tab has no icon to badge, and
 * where the API is missing this does nothing; the page title still carries
 * the count.
 *
 * The count is the page title's: replies that arrived in other conversations
 * while this window was open. It is held in memory, not fetched from the
 * server, so a reopened app starts from zero.
